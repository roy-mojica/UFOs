# UFO sightings using Java

## Overview

Builing a webpage to use a dynamic table to search UFO sightings, and have the capabilty to search by different criteria. 

## The Result

#### The page welcomes you with a quick article on UFO sightings. The main focus of the page is the table below it.

You have the abiility to search by 5 Categories: 
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

#### Once you type one or more entries in the "Filter Search" the table will change to show you the specific data you are searching for. For example the below image shows the results when you search for sightings in "tx".

#### You can simply remove the filter or refresh the page to get the original table back. 

## Summary

The biggest draw back is that this data is finite, and does not update when a new sighting has been seen. In fact, the date range for this data is 1/1/2010 - 1/13/2010.

To improve this webpage further, I would like to add an API that would continually update the data shown to do more trend analysis. Also, I would splite the date be be able to search by month and year for more additional analysis as well.
